### Footnotes

<a name="footnote1">1</a>: For students who had an easy time accepting the pass-by-value and pass-by-reference rules, here is a good-quality and patient explanation of how those somewhat contradictory rules are actually highly compatible: [Is Python pass-by-reference or pass-by-value?](https://robertheaton.com/2014/02/09/pythons-pass-by-object-reference-as-explained-by-philip-k-dick/) The bottom line is Python is indeed pass-by-value, but a list is an object &mdash; we haven't learned about objects yet! &mdash; and for objects the variable and the function argument are references to the object, not the object itself. This means that the function body gets a copy of the reference to the list, and the copy of the reference still refers to the original list.
