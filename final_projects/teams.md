## Schedule / Rubric

### Goals for Standups

Your "product" is a notebook that extends any of the work we have done this semester, and a presentation explaining that notebook to your classmates at the end of this week.

The standup is designed to help everyone focus on making progress toward completion of the product. In an industry setting a significant goal of the standup is to inform the product manager and other team members what coordination is necessary for the team to make the maximum progres.

1. Explain your topic in terms the rest of the class can understand.
2. Explain your uncertainties in your choice of topic and how to proceed.
3. Give a forward-looking status: principally, what do you plan to do between now and the next standup (or the final presentation)?
4. Is there any way in which you are blocked and can use help from your classmates in getting unblocked.
5. If you are blocked, remember, no step is to small to start getting unblocked.
