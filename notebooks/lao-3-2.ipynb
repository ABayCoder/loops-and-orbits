    "## Solow-Swan Model of Economic Growth\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first couple of days of this week, we are continuing our change-up from mechanics problems to show \n",
    "what huge applicability the methods you have been learning in this course have to other problems. Yesterday we did battery-charging. Today we are doing economics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### *Notebook by Prof. Andr&aacute;s Margitay-Becht*\n",
    "\n",
    "Prof. Margitay-Becht presented the Solow-Swan economic model. Let's review the terms and units he presented.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "An economy has a certain amount of:\n",
    "\n",
    "* GDP, Y &mdash; which in an advanced economy is a function of how much capital is in operation\n",
    "* capital, K &mdash; you can remember what that stands for because Karl Marx spelled *Das Kapital* with a K &mdash; this is the amount of machinery for production &mdash; such as silicon wafer fabrication lines, lithium-ion battery factories or cranes to build buildings\n",
    "* investment in additional capital, I &mdash; known as savings\n",
    "* depreciation of capital, D, &mdash; depreciation is due to aging of the capital stock\n",
    "* time, T &mdash; capital T in this notebook is the same as the lower-case t we have been using in our physics models &mdash; economists like capital letters for their variables\n",
    "\n",
    "(GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product and is the rate of production of goods and services.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Units\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were applying this to something like the State of California, to make the ideas more concrete you can imagine that the units are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Y, millions of USD / year\n",
    "* K, millions of USD\n",
    "* I, millions of USD / year\n",
    "* D, millions of USD / year\n",
    "* T, years\n",
    "\n",
    "(USD is the currency code for United States Dollars. Example currency codes you might run into in economics texts are CAD for Canadian dollar, EUR for Euro, JPY for Japanese Yen, or RMB for Chinese Renminbi.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Whatever units you are using, K is an amount, and Y, I, and D are amounts per time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Dependency on K\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to visualize how Y, I, and D depend on K in this model. *The graphs in that visualization will not depend on time.* They will depend on K.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Dependency on T\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to start an economy out at a certain size and be able to see (for example over the next 100 years), how that economy will grow. The most important measure of growth is Y, but we might want to visualize the annual percentage change in Y, or we might want to visualize how much capital, K, the economy has.\n",
