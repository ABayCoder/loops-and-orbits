    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "We've started to write more complicated functions. For example some of our functions return tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've started to nest the functionality (functions calling other functions), creating what is called dependencies. In the above example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The big while loop depends on `acceleration_with_drag`\n",
    "* `acceleration_with_drag` depends on several other functions including `angle_from_velocity`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Backtraces\n",
    "\n",
    "Errors can show up deep in the nesting. In the above example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the big while loop is a module and in it, we called `acceleration_with_drag`\n",
    "* `acceleration_with_drag` called `angle_from_velocity` and that was where the error is\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully you now see how backtraces directly reflect dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time the interpreter coughs up a backtrace it is trying to help you understand your code and its problems. It is exceedingly valuable to start reading them.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have often studied backtraces that are 20 to 30 levels deep, but that isn't special. In fact, I have sometimes studied backtraces that are 60 to 80 levels deep. Software developers do this all the time. Start with backtraces that are just a few deep and soon you'll be reading very deep ones. After some time you will learn what to ignore and how to home in on the actual error.\n",
    "\n",
    "Great programmers study backtraces and work with debuggers. Lousy programmers stick print statements into their code. Don't go that route. All modern computer languages have powerful debuggers. Soon I'll show you how to use the Python debugger instead of print statements when you want more diagnostics."
