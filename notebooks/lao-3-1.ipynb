    "* You have completely changed gears from mechanics to circuitry. This &mdash; and tomorrow's special class on economics with Prof. Andr&aacute;s Margitay-Becht &mdash; are designed to show you what a wide range of problems can be solved with finite-difference methods.\n",
    "* You have gained some familiarity with how physicists and electrical engineers model circuits. More specifically, you have gained some familiarity with how battery engineers model battery charging.\n",
    "* Battery charging is an excellent example of what is called a first-order differential equation. These equations are very often used in biology, ecology, and economics. First-order differential equations are actually simpler than the second-order differential equations (involving acceleration) that Newton realized were critical to the formulation of mechanics.\n",

    "I tell you truly, this is a massive amount to be getting to in just the third week of an immersion.\n",

    "Please don't stress if you are not yet feeling any sense of mastery of what you did Friday and today. I am aware that you are only gaining familiarity. Gaining familiarity is important to give you a sense of the range of what as possible with computational methods, and to know how the numpy, matplotlib, and unittest are commonly used to write high-quality scientific code."
